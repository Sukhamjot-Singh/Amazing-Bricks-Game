Amazing Bricks game on JAVASCRIPT using the canvas framework


Introduction:

Thsi JAVASCRIPT Project(Game) is based on using the Canvas framework.


Problem Description:
Motivation was to learn JavaScript. I decided to build a game to
avoid obstacles based on Android game(Amazing Bricks).

Game Description:

1. The obstacles are in form of rectangles with gaps between them coming
    randomly from above.
2. The motive of the player is to move the ball left or right to avoid the
    obstacles by going through the gap.
3. If the ball touches the obstacle ,the game gets over and your score is
    displayed, otherwise game can be played forever.
